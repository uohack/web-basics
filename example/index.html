In this case, I found a sweet Sagan pic and just pasted in it's URL. Generally, you only want to use your own photos, but this is for educational purposes so free use! -->

They do not show up in your page (except the source code) and are simply here to help you read the code better. I highly recommend you comment your code because when you come back to it after six months it's super helpful. -->
